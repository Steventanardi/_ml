7-Segment Digit Recognition with MLP (Numerical Gradient)

This project demonstrates how to build a basic Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch using NumPy. It focuses on learning the relationship between 7-segment display inputs and the corresponding digits (0â€“9). The neural network is trained using numerical gradient descent as an educational approach to understanding how MLPs work internally.
